Hi, this is my personal website and is currently under construction.

I am a second-year master’s student in Environmental Science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Currently, I'm working as a Graduate Research Assistant in a geospatial modeling team in the INFEWS project, an NSF funded project that aims for sustainable food waste management in New York State. In specific, I’m assessing the potential ecological impact of food waste digestate disposal on water quality and greenhouse gas emissions through empirical measurements and geoinformation analysis.
